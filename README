			      What it is
			      ~~~~~~~~~~

squidGuard is a free (GPL), flexible and ultra fast filter, redirector
and access controller plugin for squid.  It lets you define multiple
access rules with different restrictions for different user groups on
a squid cache.  squidGuard uses squid's standard redirector interface.
